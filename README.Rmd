[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/zachary-foster/taxa2.svg?branch=main)](https://travis-ci.org/zachary-foster/taxa2)

This is an R package that provides classes to store and manipulate taxonomic data.
Most of the classes can be used like base R vectors.
This project is currently under development and will eventually replace the [taxa](https://github.com/ropensci/taxa) package.
